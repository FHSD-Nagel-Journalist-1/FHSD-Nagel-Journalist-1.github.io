A few days ago, It was reported by HNHH (Hot New Hip Hop), that Sting, an english singer, had threatened to take legal action against rapper Juice WRLD. The producer of the song, who made the instrumental, had included a sample taken from a Sting song called “Shape of my heart”. There has been a lot of fuss online, and many people have been taunting and insulting Sting for this. However, he has all the rights to do this, and whenever an artists wants to use another artist’s work, they must have a written agreement before it is fair use. This is important because it is unfair for everyone to go around taking other people's work without any permission. Sting also has a long history of charity work, so maybe it isn’t so bad after all that he decided to take legal action. Better communication would have prevented this from ever happening. Yesterday, Juice WRLD said this regarding the situation, “Lost Millions, made millions.”, and he seemed not to care at all.
