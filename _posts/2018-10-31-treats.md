### Pumpkin Cookies

Looking for the perfect fall cookies? Iâ€™ve got you covered! I found this super simple, and delicious soft pumpkin cookies! They make about 3 dozen cookies. You make the batter,  scoop or pipe them into a muffin tin with a little bit of powder sugar, and you're perfect! From the recipe description, the dough can be pretty sticky, so you may want to chill it to get the perfect dough!
