### By Amanda Branhan

  Over the summer, Nagel got an exciting new addition to our community. Having a new principal is something that everyone has to get used to, but these first few months of school seem to have gone great! While students and staff may be nervous about having a new person in charge, we have to remember that the new principal is just as nervous. I was curious about the change that Ms. Eshleman was going through and asked her a few questions. The goal of the interview was to see what was happening at Nagel during the change.

Amanda - How has the beginning of the school year gone for you?
Ms. Eshleman - As with any new job, it takes time to transition and get the hang of it. The cool part of being principal at Nagel is that every day is different and there is not "user guide" to tell me how to handle each situation, so I learn something new from moment to moment. I have enjoyed getting to know students, staff, and families at Nagel and being able to see the learning experiences our kids are a part of each day.

Amanda - How is Nagel different than other schools you have worked with?
Ms. Eshleman - Nagel is much larger than other schools I have taught in or been principal of. There are about twice as many students and staff than other schools and the building itself is much larger. There are benefits to the size though. I get my steps in each day and our students have so many opportunities and resources. Clubs, world language choices, STEM classes, multiple music, and art classes, and the many athletic teams offer something for every student!

Amanda - People sometimes get confused about what exactly a principal of a middle school does. What exactly is your job?
Ms. Eshleman - Each day is different. I work with teacher teams and our administrative team to determine what is important for our students to learn to the best of their ability. As a principal, I hire new teachers and staff, I evaluate staff, I approve what can be purchased and budget for what needs to be purchased. I visit classrooms to see what is working for our students and what is not. When something is not working to help students learn, I work with teams and individuals to figure out why and what we can do differently. In order to do this well, I also have to get to know students, listen to them, and share their feedback. I also work with Nagel parents and the community to raise money and help to provide various opportunities for our students and staff.

Amanda - What do you feel is the most important aspect of your job here?
Ms. Eshleman - Making sure that students are learning in an environment where they feel safe, welcome, enjoy the process, feel supported, and have a sense of belonging & pride is the most important thing I can influence.

Amanda - How long have you been working with kids? What jobs have you had before coming to Nagel?
Ms. Eshleman - I have been in the education field for 20 years. I have been a teacher at elementary and middle schools and a principal at the elementary and middle school. I also have worked with students and teachers as a "School Improvement Coach" and most recently at the Forest Hills Central Office as the Associate Director of Curriculum.

Amanda - What do you hope to accomplish during your first year here at Nagel?
Ms. Eshleman - I hope to make connections with many students and each and every staff member so that I can genuinely know what is going well and what can be improved for our students. I hope to offer a place where students want to be, teachers love their jobs, and families feel connected!

Amanda - What do you hope to accomplish during your whole time here at Nagel?
Ms. Eshleman - Basically, everything I shared about the important aspects of my job: ensure that Nagel is an awesome place to learn for every student, staff member, and their families and continue to provide engaging opportunities that connect us to the community and the world around us!!

Nagel is lucky to have a new principal that cares so much about how students are doing in their classes. This school is so great and students do so well because we have staff that actually cares about every single kid. If you didn’t know, advisory was set up so that each kid had at least one staff member that knew them well. Nagel is one of the top middle schools in Ohio, and it’s all because of these teachers that take time out of their lives to connect with students. 

Based on the information from the interview, Ms. Eshleman seems like she is going to be a wonderful addition to the Nagel community. Her mind is already set on connecting with people and making this school a better place. Thank you Ms. Eshleman!
