TenMarks will no longer be available after the 2018-19 school year, according to the message, and licenses for TenMarks Math and TenMarks Writing will expire after June 30, 2019. Meanwhile, the company's social media accounts will be closed by June 30 of this year. This will have a huge impact on education, because schools use Tenmarks in math universally, as it is makes it easy for the teacher to grade, and is easily accessible for students. This will cause a giant change in math class! What will teachers do instead for homework?
