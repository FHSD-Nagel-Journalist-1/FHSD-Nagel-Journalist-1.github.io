### Pumpkin Pie: It's Fall!
You know what time of year it is! Pumpkin flavor fall. Get ready for pumpkin flavored everything. 
Haven’t had pumpkin  pie but want to try it? Here’s the perfect recipe for a beginner.

### Time:
Prep time:  20 minutes
Cooking time:  40 minutes
Ready in: 1 hour

### Ingredients: (for pie filling)
2 cups mashed pumpkin
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
½ teaspoon ground ginger
½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
½ teaspoon salt

### Ingredients: (for pie crust)
1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon salt
½ cup shortening
3 ½ tablespoons cold water
¾ cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs, beaten
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk

### Directions
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F

Prepare pie crust by mixing together the flour and salt. Cut shortening into flour; add cold water 1 tablespoon at a time (you may need only 3 tablespoons, or up to 4 tablespoons). Mix dough and repeat until dough is moist enough to hold together.

With lightly floured, hands shape dough into a ball. On a lightly floured board roll dough out to about 1/8 inch thickness. With a sharp knife, cut dough 1 1/2 inch larger than the upside-down 8- to 9-inch pie pan. Gently roll the dough around the rolling pin and transfer it right-side up onto the pie pan. Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of the pie pan.

In a large bowl, beat pumpkin with evaporated milk, eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and salt with an electric mixer or immersion blender. Mix well. Pour into a prepared crust. Bake 40 minutes or until when a knife is inserted 1 inch from the edge comes out clean.

Happy cooking! Have a pumpkin-filled fall!
