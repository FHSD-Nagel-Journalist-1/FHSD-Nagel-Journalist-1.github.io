	This is going to be my last article, as this is the last week of our round of Journalism AFT. I’d like to show you a little bit into our AFT, if you would come to be in it.
	In Journalism AFT, we’re separated into four different groups. The one that I’m in, that brings you the articles, the website crew, the yearbook group and the poster people.
	Next, the article crew writes and edits the articles and then they send them to the website crew. The website crew puts the articles up on the blog, which is the app you’re using to see the writing pieces now.
	The yearbook group makes digital backgrounds for the yearbook. The pictures you see in the background just might be from the ones they make. Along with working a lot of technical things for the yearbook, they take pictures from around the school and all kinds of other things.
Finally, the poster people have been working on putting up all kinds of new and inspirational posters from around school. You might see them when going to lunch and around in the hallways. They also make informational digital posters about sports and all sorts of other Nagel events.
	Those are the four groups that make up Journalism AFT, and together they make up the group that gives you all of these great articles.

	Signing off, Jade
