### Anderson Vs.Turpin


It was the start of the game and every person in the stadium was going crazy. They were ready to see what they have been waiting for since last fall. It was cold and raining. The Turpin Spartans were ready to take on the Anderson Redskins. Jake Silverstein, who is the Turpin quarterback, threw for two touchdowns. Turpinâ€™s running back Reese Evans had run in for 2 touchdowns as well. Turpin had a good mindset at the end of the 1st half, but Anderson had a better mindset. Even though that Turpin had a 7 point lead at the half, Anderson came and fired out with a 21 
point lead at the end of the third. Turpin had not scored at all in the second half of the game, but the fans for Turpin were still having a great time like after each touchdown that Turpin fans would throw SMOKE BOMBS in the air. So no matter if you are a Turpin or Anderson fan, overall it was a great game!
