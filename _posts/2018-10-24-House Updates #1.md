### By Macy Courtney

  	House 1A and 1B are very busy with their “I believe” projects in  Language Arts. They are also working on the challenge in 
    science to find a reliable source of energy for rescue workers. In accelerated Math, they are working hard on rational numbers 
    and using operations with the rational numbers as well. In Fusion, they are hard at work at their Intro To Me videos to update
    their digital learning portfolio. Houses 2A and 2B are very busy with the “I believe” project in teaming up in  Language Arts 
    and Fusion, a Socratic Seminar in Science, determining if we should have zoos or not,  a compare and contrast of Athens and Sparta 
    in Social Studies, and rational number and beginning exponents in Math. Houses 3A and 3B are busy working in Math class on solving
    equation stations. In  Language Arts, they are reading short stories to help further understand literary/story elements, like mood,
    tone, theme, characterization, etc, and how stories are basically about protagonists who are characters on quests. In Science, they
    are working on landforms made by erosion and deposition and also how animal populations that live there adapt to the landform/envir
    onment. In Social Studies they are working on colonization. House 4A and 4B are working on a redesign project in Nagel for Fusion. 
    In Math, they are learning angle relationships. In Language Arts, they are working on a book called Refuge. In Science, they are learning how to make topographical maps, and in Social Studies they are learning about the American Revolution.
    Nagel Nation is hard at work on many different exciting projects! We hope to see many more great things from the Nighthawks!
