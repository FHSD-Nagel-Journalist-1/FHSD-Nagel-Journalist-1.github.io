Thanksgiving break is right around the corner. These few days can be used to relax, catch up on much-needed sleep, travel, or explore Cincinnati. Down below are small descriptions and links so if your interested, you can check it out! 

If you enjoy a thrill-seeking adventure I recommend the Truth or Dare: A Reality Show. This works to promoted illusion and the real and present, and the difference between fact and fiction. This is a late night activity its open 24 hours, I would call before you decide to explore this real life reality. 
The address is 21C MUSEUM HOTEL 609 Walnut Cincinnati, OH 

The link to check out this show is: <a href="https://cincinnatiusa.com/events/truth-or-dare-reality-show"> https://cincinnatiusa.com/events/truth-or-dare-reality-show</a> 

Next is the Sky Star Observation Wheel, in Downtown Cincinnati. This observation wheel features a 12-minute ride and costs $12.50 per person. This ride goes 150 feet up into the air, inside the enclosed gondolas that seat up to six people, and is worth it for the amazing view of the Queen City! You can go online to view hours, and purchase tickets!
