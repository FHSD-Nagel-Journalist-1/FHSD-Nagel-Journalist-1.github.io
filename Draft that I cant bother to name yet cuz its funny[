According to the Nielsen Company Harris Poll, 42% of Americans believe in ghosts.  <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/foresthills.edu/open?id=1vtwGUU7HEjniCp1F-QBbhE00nhMVrPeu&usp=sharing">This link</a> will bring you to some of the places considered the most haunted in Cincinnati. A former school, Poasttown Elementary, is now considered to be one of the most haunted places in Cincinnati. 5 years after the school was closed, a new owner bought it. He reported unexplainable noises and even the men he hired to work on the old building, that he described as “big and tough”, were scared. Many people have tried to work in the empty rooms of the building and almost all of them have come out of that building believing in ghosts. Many investigators have been hired and they all come out with evidence that it is, in fact, haunted. There are different theories as to why it may be haunted. Perhaps the train wreck that caused 24 deaths that happened just down the road. Where the school was later built, there was a holding place for the dead and 35 injured. Also, some believe that ghosts are people who have not completely crossed over, and they go back to the place they were happiest. Many people believe that people were happiest in elementary school, where life was easy and fun. The owner chooses to believe that the building is haunted from ghosts that were happiest there, but there are many possibilities if it is in fact haunted.
